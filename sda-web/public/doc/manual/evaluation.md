# Evaluation

1. **InStability**

Instability represents the ratio of efferent coupling to total coupling. Instability is less, the better.

2. **CHM (CoHesion at Message level)**

CHM is used to measure the average cohesion of service interfaces at message level.CHM is more, the better.

3. **CHD (CoHesion at Domain level)**

CHD is used to measure the average cohesion of service interfaces at domain level.CHD is more, the better.

4. **IFN (InterFace Number)**

IFN indicates the number of interfaces provided by an extracted service to other services averagely. IFN is smaller, the better.

5. **OPN (OPeration Number)**

OPN denotes the number of operations provided by the extracted microservices. OPN is less, the better.

6. **IRN (InteRaction Number)**

IRN represents the number of method calls across two services. IRN is smaller, the better.
